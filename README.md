# The Things Stack LoRaWAN Network Server

![The Things Stack CE for Raspberry Pi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xoseperez/the-things-stack-docker/master/resources/logo_small.png)

## Introduction

This project deploys the The Things Stack LoRaWAN Network Server (Open Source Edition) on a PC, a Raspberry Pi or equivalent SBC using docker.

Main features:

* Supports for AMD64 (x86_64), ARMv8 and ARMv7 architectures.
* Automatically creates a configuration file based on environment variables
* Creates a self signed certificate
* Configures the identity database
  * Initializes it
  * Creates an admin
  * Creates oauth clients for the CLI and the console
* Support for Packet Broker

Based on [The Things Stack](https://hub.docker.com/r/thethingsnetwork/lorawan-stack/) image.

This project is available on Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/r/xoseperez/the-things-stack) and GitHub (https://github.com/xoseperez/the-things-stack).

This is a Work In Progress. It is **not meant for production environments** but it should work just fine for local (LAN) deployments.

## Requirements

### Hardware

As long as the host can run docker containers, the The Things Stack service can run on:

* AMD64: most PCs out there
* ARMv8: Raspberry Pi 3/4, 400, Compute Module 3/4, Zero 2 W,...
* ARMv7: Raspberry Pi 2

> **NOTE**: you will need an OS in the host machine, for some SBC like a Raspberry Pi that means and SD card with an OS (like Rasperry Pi OS) flashed on it.

### Software

If you are going to use docker to deploy the project, you will need:

* An OS running your host (Linux or MacOS for AMD64 systems, Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu OS for ARM,...)
* Docker (and optionally docker-compose) on the machine (see below for installation instructions)
* [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher) to burn the OS image on the SD card or eMMC for SBC if you have not already done so

If you are going to use this image with Balena, you will need:

* A balenaCloud account ([sign up here](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/))


### Network

Even thou they are not necessary, you may want to have:

* a static IP for the device (either in the device itself or using a DHCP lease on your router)
* a domain (or a subdomain of a domain you already have) pointing to the device

Check the `Configuring the domain` section below for different options to fulfull these two options.


## Deploy

### Deploy using docker compose

You can use the next `docker-compose.yml` file to configure and run your instance of The Things Stack.

Modify the `TTS_DOMAIN` environment variable to match your setup. 

### One-click deploy via [Balena Deploy](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/deploy/deploy-with-balena-button/)

Running this project is as simple as deploying it to a balenaCloud application. You can do it in just one click by using the button below:

[![](https://www.balena.io/deploy.png)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/xoseperez/the-things-stack-docker)

Follow instructions, click Add a Device and flash an SD card with that OS image dowloaded from balenaCloud. Enjoy the magic ðŸŒŸOver-The-AirðŸŒŸ!

### In-control deploy via [Balena-Cli](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/balena-cli/)

If you are a balena CLI expert, feel free to use balena CLI. This option lets you configure in detail some options, like adding new services to your deploy or configure de DNS Server to use.

- Sign up on [balena.io](https://dashboard.balena.io/signup)
- Create a new fleet on balenaCloud.
- Add a new device and download the image of the BalenaOS it creates.
- This is the moment to configure the DNS server in the BalenaOS if required. See the `Configuring the domain` section  below.
- Burn and SD card (if using a Pi), connect it to the device and boot it up.

While the device boots (it will eventually show up in the Balena dashboard) we will prepare de services:

- Clone this repository to your local workstation. Don't forget to update the submodules.
```
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/xoseperez/the-things-stack-docker
cd the-things-stack-docker
```
- Using [Balena CLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/cli/), push the code with `balena push <fleet-name>`
- See the magic happening, your device is getting updated ðŸŒŸOver-The-AirðŸŒŸ!

## Log in

Point your browser to the first local IP of the device or to the domain name (if you have defined one) using HTTPS and use the default credentials (admin/changeme) to log in as administrator.

## Details

### Resetting values

Certificates are recreated if TTS_DOMAIN or any TTS_SUBJECT_* variable below changes.
Database is reset if TTS_DOMAIN, TTS_ADMIN_EMAIL, TTS_ADMIN_PASSWORD or TTS_CONSOLE_SECRET change.

Alternatively you can run the `reset.sh` script fro within the container and restart it.

```
docker exec -it stack /home/thethings/reset.sh
```

### Configuring the IP and domain

You want to assign your device a fixed IP or a domain name where you can always reach it. Here you have a few clues on how to do it.

#### Static IP

To reach the IP or to properly configure a domain or subdomain you will have to configure the Raspberry Pi with a static address. You have two options here:

1. Configure a static lease on your home router linking the RPi MAC with an IP. Everytime the RPi boots it will ask for an IP using DHCP (this is the default) and router will allways gfive it the same IP.

2. Configure a static IP on the RPi itself instead of using DHCP. 

#### Configuring the domain or subdomain

Once you know the PI will always be accessible at the same IP, there are a number of ways to define a domain name or a subdomain pointing to the device IP. After doing any of these approaches change the TTS_DOMAIN environment variable accordingly so the stack service recreates the right certificates for the domain.

1. Using a DNS in your LAN, like PiHole, dnsmask,... these will work great inside your LAN. But this option requires an extra step since BalenaOS by default uses Google DNS servers (8.8.8.8). So you have to instruct it to use your local DNS server instead. 

2. Using a third party service, like Cloudflare, for instance. If you are managing a domain from such a service you can just add an A register for a subdomain pointing to your local (or public) IP address.

```
A lns.ttn.cat 192.168.1.25
```

Then you just have to wait for the domain name to propagate.

### Packet Broker

The Packet Broker is a service provided by The Things Industries (TTI) that allows peering between networks. To use the Pacet Broker you need:

* A NetID provided by the LoRaWAN Alliance or a subrange of addresses from an existing NetID (TTI provides such service)
* A Packet Broker ID and Secret provided by TTI

If you want to fully integrate your cluster with The Things Network, this can be achieved by configuring TTS_NET_ID to "000013" (NetID owned by The Things Industries) and set the TTS_DEVADDR_RANGE to the range leased from TTI. Then configure the rest of PB_* variables with the info provided by TTI. All these variables must go to the `environment` section in the `stack` service or added as environment variables in the Balena Dashboard.

### Variables

------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**TTS_SERVER_NAME** | `STRING` | Name of the server | The Things Stack

**PB_OAUTH_ID** | `STRING` | Packet Broker API key ID | 
**PB_OAUTH_SECRET** | `STRING` | Packet Broker API secret | 

**Note**: the container uses the `wait` tool (https://github.com/ufoscout/docker-compose-wait) to check that Redis and PostgreSQL are running before starting the stack. The **WAIT_\*** environment variables are there to configure this feature.

## Troubleshooting

* If you are having certificates problems or "token rejected" message on the TTS website, try regenerating the credentials by changing any of the SUBJECT_* variables. You can also open a terminal to the `stack` service, delete the `/srv/data/certificates_signature` file and restart the stack service.

* If the database fails to initialize the best way to force the start script to init it again is to change any of these variables: TTS_ADMIN_EMAIL, TTS_ADMIN_PASSWORD or TTS_CONSOLE_SECRET. You can also open a terminal to the `stack` service, delete the `/srv/data/database_signature` file and restart the stack service.

* When the database is reconfigured (because you change any of the environment variables in the previous point) the passwords for the admin and the console are overwritten. So if you are logged in as admin you will have to logout and login again with the default password.

## TODO

* Lots of testing :)
* Testing performance (# of devices) on different platforms
* Option to use ACME / Let's Encrypt for valid certificates
* Option to configure a connection to the Packet Broker
